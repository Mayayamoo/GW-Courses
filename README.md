# GW-Courses

Was bored and just enrolled at GW (yay) so created a scraper to create an easy to manage directory of all classes at George Washington University. 
For some reason no database like it is available. 

The second part of the program allows you to filter it by classes taken, departments youre interested, program requirements etc to give you a nice filtered directory of classes pertinent to you. 

There's some minimal predependancy mapping, allows you to filter by classes you have completed all the necessary prerequisites for. 

Does some other stuff too
